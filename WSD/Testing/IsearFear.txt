I was walking through a thick forest and there was a big snake at 
a distance of about four metres.
When I was young I had gone to an old lift and played with the 
antique lift.  The guy discovered me and warned me, I was very 
frightened.
At night when I was alone at home (all the family members usually 
get together at that time) someone knocked vigorously on the 
door.
The day I encountered a queer mamba face to face in a chunk of 
leaves behind our house.
