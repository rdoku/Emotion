In September 1984, I was forced to live with someone I did not 
like.  The first week we were at loggerheads and our conversation 
was like a debate.  The atmosphere was very bad.  When he learnt 
that I had got 95 marks in a test he told me  A failure, You lost 
5 marks.   I was very angry, not because my marks were lower 
than his, but because I could not tolerate his pride.  I did not 
show my discontentment and carried on doing my work.

When I got into a bus I found that my wallet had been stolen. 
It was not a great loss from the monetary point of view but I 
lost some documents - identity papers.  As a result I had to 
spend several days in order to get a new one.  I will always 
remember all the work I had to do and the bad treatment I 
suffered because of the bureaucratic behaviour of the civil 
servant.  I had already had bad luck and they treated me like a 
criminal.   At one point of time I really wanted to quarrel with 
them.
A male, Honduran acquaintance of mine despised my opinions.
I was on vacation, and therefore I did not attend a meeting of

When I entered university the girl's parents suggested that I be 
employed as their daghters tutor.  They told me that at university  
there was no homework and I would have a lot of time so they 
made a time-table  for me which required me to be the tutor five 
days a week.  They did not respect me and anyway I had another 
child to teach.
A girl I was with went off with another guy.
The day the results of the Chinese university was announced I 
should have been very happy; however my grandmother, because of  
her prejudice and misunderstanding, started a  quarrel with my 
mother.  She expected me to take her side and she deliberately 
talked of my mother's wrong doings.  I was very angry because -

should have been a happy day and three we had moved into a new 
house that day.

in touch with me.
