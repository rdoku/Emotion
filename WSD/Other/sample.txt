    You people have a serious attitude problem! By the time I got through your Jan. 22 issue I was worn down by your snotty, groovier-then-thou, ultra-hip, snivelling, fuck everybody attitude. Bowles is never going to endear himself to the Austin public by slamming the Cowboys, and that bitchy little weewee Tony Sivle told me nothing about the records he was reviewing, ad nauseum. I hope your publication dies a quick and painful death in the finest Austin tradition.
