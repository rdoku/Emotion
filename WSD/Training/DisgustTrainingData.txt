in a city like Bombay.  One day I was travelling by bus, three 
men dragged two fellows out of the bus.  Once outside they were 
beaten into pulp.  These two fellows, who got beaten, were pick-pockets 
and they were being beaten by all and sundry.  I thought to 
myself -what is life?.  It is one hell of a place where 
everyone is after someone else.  One waits to cut the throat of 
the other one just for a living, (money).  When I think about 
such things - the purpose of life, etc, I feel very disgusted and 
dejected.
I was looking after a dying patient at work one night, a young 
woman, my colleague was talking to her relatives and .... to 
offer them any support emotionally, physically and then sent them

to do some work. Seeing them again I felt disgusted at her 
attitude.

guy.

silly and at first it was ok, but it went on and on - yukky pooh!

Disgust - no. Maybe it is more precise to say revultion at a worm 
or a snake. But I mean it in a social aspect when somebody had 
behaved like a scoundrel to you, when by his actions he has made 
you change your attitude towards him but I thing this feeling the 
way I meant it, is not typical for the people interrelations.
